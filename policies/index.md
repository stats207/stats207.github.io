## General course policies

**Gender expression/identity:**
This course affirms people of all gender expressions and gender identities. If you prefer to be called a different name than what is indicated on the class roster, please let me know. Feel free to correct me on your preferred gender pronoun. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me.

**Code of conduct:**
You are expected to treat the instructional team and your fellow students with courtesy and respect.
This class should be a harassment-free learning experience for everyone regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. Harassment of any form will not be tolerated.
If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it as soon as possible to one of the instructors. If you are not comfortable approaching the instructional team, you may also contact the [Stanford Office of the Ombuds](https://ombuds.stanford.edu/)

**Students with Documented Disabilities:**
If you have an OAE letter, please present it to us (by email to the staff llist) at your earliest convenience, so we can ensure that the course materials and staff support comply with your needs. 

**Financial accessibility**
Stanford University and its instructors are committed to ensuring that all courses are financially accessible to all students. If you are an undergraduate who needs assistance with the cost of course textbooks, supplies, materials and/or fees, you are welcome to approach me directly. If would prefer not to approach me directly, please note that you can ask the Diversity & First-Gen Office for assistance by completing their [questionnaire on course textbooks & supplies](http://tinyurl.com/jpqbarn) or by contacting Joseph Brown, the Associate Director of the Diversity and First-Gen Office (jlbrown@stanford.edu). Dr. Brown is available to connect you with resources and support while ensuring your privacy.

## Course assistance and personal support

In every quarter we have taught, there have been individual students who have encountered life-altering challenges, so it is not the case that empathy and compassion have only just become relevant. However, the magnitude of the current crisis underscores the need to support each other. If you feel overwhelmed for any reason—by work for this class, or a family issue, or just the weight of the present moment for the globe, please don’t hesitate to reach out. Or, if you just need to talk, or have us send you a kitten video, or if you need extra tutoring support in the class, we are here for you. Please ask us. *Please ask us.*
