## Learning objectives

Students should be able to do each of the following by the end of this course:


### What is statistics? overview of the course
* Describe the central goals and fundamental concepts of statistics.
* Describe the difference between experimental and observational research with regard to what can be inferred about causality
* Explain how randomization provides the ability to make inferences about causation.

### Working with data
* Distinguish between different types of variables (quantitative/qualitative, discrete/continuous)
* Describe the concept of measurement error
* Distinguish between the concepts of reliability and validity and apply each concept to a particular dataset

### R Lab: Basics
* Interact with an RMarkdown notebook in RStudio
* Describe the difference between a variable and a function
* Create a vector, matrix, or data frame and access its elements
* Load data from an R package and view the data

### Summarizing data
* Compute absolute, relative, and cumulative frequency distributions for a given dataset
* Generate a graphical representation of frequency distributions
* Describe the difference between a normal and a long-tailed distribution, and describe the situations that give rise to each

### Visualizing data
* Describe the principles that distinguish between good and bad graphs, and use them to identify good versus bad graphs.

### R Lab: Data visualization
* Plot summary graphs using ggplot

### Fitting models (central tendency)
* Describe the basic equation for statistical models (outcome=model + error)
* Describe different measures of central tendency, how they are computed, and which are appropriate under what circumstance.

### Fitting models (central tendency) and z-scores
* Describe different measures of dispersion, how they are computed, and how to determine which is most appropriate in any given circumstance. Describe and compute z-scores.

### Probability
* Describe the sample space for a selected random experiment.
* Compute relative frequency and empirical probability for a given set of events
* Compute probabilities of single events, complementary events, and the unions and intersections of collections of events.
* Describe the law of large numbers.
* Describe the difference between a probability and a conditional probability
* Describe the concept of statistical independence
* Use Bayesâ€™ theorem to compute the inverse conditional probability.

### Sampling
* Distinguish between a population and a sample, and between population parameters and statistics
* Describe the concepts of sampling error and sampling distribution
* Describe how the Central Limit Theorem determines the nature of the sampling distribution of the mean

### Resampling
* Describe the concept of a Monte Carlo simulation.
* Describe the meaning of randomness in statistics
* Obtain random numbers from the uniform and normal distributions
* Describe the concept of the bootstrap

### Hypothesis testing
* Identify the components of a hypothesis test, including the parameter of interest, the null and alternative hypotheses, and the test statistic.
* Describe the proper interpretations of a p-value as well as common misinterpretations
* Distinguish between the two types of error in hypothesis testing, and the factors that determine them.
* Describe how resampling can be used to compute a p-value.
* Describe the main criticisms of null hypothesis statistical testing

### Quantifying effects and designing studies
* Describe the proper interpretation of a confidence interval, and compute a confidence interval for the mean of a given dataset.
* Define the concept of effect size, and compute the effect size for a given test.
* Define the concept of statistical power, and compute statistical power for a given statistical test.

### Modeling categorical relationships
* Describe the concept of a contingency table for categorical data.
* Describe the concept of the chi-squared test for association and compute it for a given contingency table.

### Modeling continuous relationships
* Describe the concept of the correlation coefficient and its interpretation and compute it for a bivariate dataset
* Describe the potential causal influences that can give rise to a correlation.

### The general linear model
* Describe the concept of linear regression and apply it to a bivariate dataset
* Describe the concept of the general linear model and provide examples of its application

### Comparing means
* Determine whether a one-sample t-test or two-sample t-test is appropriate for a given hypothesis.
* Compute a one-sample and two-sample t-test on relevant datasets, and compute the effect size and confidence intervals associated with each of these tests.

### Statistical Inference R lab
* Demonstrate the ability to apply statistical models to real data in R

### Statistical modeling: Practical examples
* Describe how to determine what kind of model to apply to a dataset

### Doing reproducible research
* Describe the concept of P-hacking and its effects on scientific practice
* Describe the concept of positive predictive value and its relation to statstical power
