**Prerequisites**: basic course in Statistics at the level of 200

**Course Requirements**: Familiarity with a programming language.
 
**Website**: The primary web site for the class is [stats207.stanford.edu](http://stats207.github.io). We will also use [Canvas](https://canvas.stanford.edu) for class lecture recordings.

**Discussion**.  We will use Ed to allow you to get help efficiently from both your classmates and the instructors ([class Ed page](Ed)). Please post your questions about the course material and course logistics to Ed so that everyone can benefit from the answer. We also highly encourage you to answer your classmates’ questions whenever possible – you will get extra practice with the material and receive feedback from the teaching team about your answers. As an added incentive, students who provide frequent, high-quality answers may receive extra credit on their final course grades. Additional guidelines about posting on Ed are available on the [Ed page](https://edstem.org).

The VPTL office offers tutoring for this class by appointment, which can be scheduled [here](https://learningconnection.stanford.edu/appointments-and-drop-schedule).

- Please don’t search for answers on the web, Google, etc.
 - please ask us if you are not sure if you can use a particular reference

###Regrade requests
- Must wait 24 hours before submitting a regrade request after grading has been published
- Subsequently, requests submitted via Gradescope within one week of grades being published
