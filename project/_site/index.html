<h2 id="stats60-final-project">STATS60: Final Project</h2>

<p>The project counts for 40% of your total grade, and has two components: a project proposal (worth 80% of the project grade)  and a final project (worth 20% of the project grade).</p>

<h2 id="project-proposal-20">Project Proposal (20%)</h2>

<p>For the project proposal, submit a 1-2 paragraph description of your final project. You should provide details on the problem you wish to explore, any datasets that you will use, and potential visualizations. The proposal is a way for me to make sure that you have enough structure and data to complete the project. To get full credit, you should ensure that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The question is clearly stated</li>
  <li>The motivation for the question is clearly explained</li>
  <li>It is clear where the data came from and how it was obtained</li>
  <li>The variables in the data are correctly identified</li>
  <li>The planned cleaning and data wrangling process is clearly explained and it is appropriate</li>
  <li>There are at least two limitations explained and these limitations are logical.</li>
</ul>

<p>The project proposal should be submitted as a pdf file on Gradescope.</p>

<p>In implementing your final project, you should try to stick as closely to your proposal as possible. If you are unable to do so, please provide a paragraph in your final project to explain the deviations from the proposal.</p>

<p>Here are some examples of good student project proposals from previous runs of this class: <a href="proposal1.pdf">Example Proposal 1</a> - <a href="proposal2.pdf">Example Proposal 2</a></p>

<h2 id="final-project-80">Final Project (80%)</h2>

<p>To demonstrate your understanding of the material we have covered, you will perform a data analysis project in R. 
<strong>You may choose to do a project on your own or with up to two other teammates.</strong> (If working with a teammate, only one person has to submit the work. The names and SUNet IDs of both teams should be clearly labeled.)</p>

<p>Here are the project minimum requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>.Rmd file, as well as 1 .html file. (Don’t worry about what these file formats are and how to create them right now; we’ll talk about this later in the course.)
Work with a dataset not used in class. Provide the data file and/or a link to it. My advice is to use a dataset that is in .csv or .txt format, as these will be easier to import into R.</li>
  <li>An “Introduction” section describing the problem and the datasets to be used. This should include top-level summaries of the data (e.g. how many observations and features, histogram/scatterplots of values, anything unusual).</li>
  <li>A “Data analysis” section where you have both code and accompanying text describing what the code is doing and interpreting the results.
At least 3 data visualizations, each of a different type. (If working with a teammate, at least 6 data visualizations, with at least 3 different types.)</li>
  <li>A “Conclusion” section to summarize the results of the analysis, as well as any deviations from the project proposal.</li>
</ul>

<p>While your analysis should not be too skimpy, it does not have to be comprehensive either. Take a look at the links below for examples of what the final project could look like, as well as ideas for datasets which you might want to work on.</p>

<h2 id="grading-and-deadlines">Grading and Deadlines</h2>

<p>Both the project proposal and final project should be submitted through <a href="https://gradescope.com">Gradescope</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The project proposal is due by <strong>July 15 (Wed), 5PM Pacific Time</strong> and is worth 20%.</li>
  <li>The final project is due by <strong>August 11 (Tue), 5PM Pacific Time</strong> and is worth 80%.</li>
</ul>

<p>For each late day, a multiplicative penalty factor of 0.8 will be applied. <strong>The final project cannot be submitted late</strong>. If you foresee that you may have difficulty meeting these deadlines, please come and speak with me <strong>immediately</strong>.</p>
