## STATS207: Final Project

Your class project is an opportunity for you to explore an interesting statistics problem of your choice with the tools and methods related to nonparametric regression and classification.  You can choose from one of the three options: (1) a list of projects provided, (2) recreate results from a paper listed, or (3) propose your own idea. 

It will be an individual project.  Your project will be worth 40% of your final class grade, and will have two final deliverables:

- a writeup in the format of a NIPS paper (8 pages maximum in NIPS format, including references; this page limit is strict), due on Tuesday June 10 (emailed to the instructors list, NO LATE SUBMISSION ACCEPTED since we need to get your grades in), worth 60% of the project grade.

- a poster presenting your work for the class poster session on Friday June 6 (Time TBA) in the Atrium of the Allen Center (CSE), worth 20% of the project grade (Please see the details in the Poster Session below). 

 In addition, you need to turn in a midway progress report (3 pages maximum in NIPS format, including references) describing the results of your first experiments by Thursday May 22, worth 20% of the project grade. Note that, as with any conference, the page limits are strict! Papers over the limit will not be considered.

Both the project proposal and the final project must be submitted as a pdf file on Gradescope. If working with one or more teammate, only one person has to submit the work. The names and SUNet IDs of both teams should be clearly labeled. Your proposal should have a paragraph outlining the planned contributions of each member.
For both submissions, **the person who submits the assignment must make sure that all group members are added to the Gradescope submission**. Here is a tutorial on how to do this: [step 1 screenshot](step1.png) - [step 2 screenshot](step2.png).

## Project Proposal (20%)

For the project proposal, submit a 1-2 paragraph description of your final project. You should provide details on the problem you wish to explore, any datasets that you will use, and potential visualizations. The proposal is a way for me to make sure that you have enough structure and data to complete the project. To get full credit, you should ensure that:
- The question is clearly stated
- The motivation for the question is clearly explained
- It is clear where the data came from and how it was obtained
- The variables in the data are correctly identified
- The planned cleaning and data wrangling process is clearly explained and it is appropriate
- There are at least two limitations explained and these limitations are logical.

In implementing your final project, you should try to stick as closely to your proposal as possible. If you are unable to do so, please provide a paragraph in your final project to explain the deviations from the proposal.

## Final Project (80%)

To demonstrate your understanding of the material we have covered, you will perform a data analysis project in R.
